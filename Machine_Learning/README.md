📁 Machine Learning Projects


This folder contains basic code implementations of various machine learning algorithms — ranging from simple models like decision trees and linear regressions to more complete, end-to-end ML solutions. It’s intended as a learning resource and a foundation for building more advanced projects.

• Decision Tree Classifier

• Linear Regression Model

• End-to-End ML Pipeline (still needs translation to english)
