# AI_Proyects

Projects


This repository contains a collection of projects and notebooks covering key topics in modern AI development, including:

Data Science: Exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and visualization techniques

Machine Learning: Classic algorithms such as linear models, decision trees, and ensemble methods

Deep Learning: Neural network implementations using frameworks like PyTorch

Reinforcement Learning: A series of Jupyter notebooks walking through foundational to advanced RL algorithms (e.g., TD Learning, REINFORCE, Actor-Critic, PPO)

⚠️ Usage Notes

The code is written in Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) format.
For best readability and to execute the notebooks interactively, it is recommended to download the repository and open the notebooks locally using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.

Important: Some notebooks use relative or hardcoded file paths for reading data or saving models.
Be sure to adjust the paths according to your local file structure before running them.
